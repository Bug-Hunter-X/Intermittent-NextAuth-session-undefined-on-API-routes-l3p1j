# Intermittent NextAuth Session Issue on API Routes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the NextAuth session object is intermittently undefined on API routes, even when a user is logged in.  The issue appears to be related to the timing of session verification and request handling.  The solution involves adding a retry mechanism to ensure session availability.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the original API route that experiences the intermittent session undefined error.  The `unstable_getServerSession` function sometimes returns `undefined`, causing authorization failures. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution that implements a retry mechanism to handle the intermittent failure. It attempts to retrieve the session multiple times before giving up. 

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the inconsistent behavior of the API route.

## Note

This issue is likely related to the asynchronous nature of NextAuth and the timing of requests.  The retry approach provides a workaround, but investigating the root cause within NextAuth might provide a more robust solution.
